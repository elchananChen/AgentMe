It appears I hit a rate limit on the GitHub API while trying to fetch the project structure for `ElchananChen/Mock-Social`.

Since I cannot explore the file structure or read any files, I cannot provide a detailed architectural analysis or a professional summary of the "Why" and "How" of the project.

**To proceed, I would need to successfully execute the following steps (which were blocked by the rate limit):**

1.  **Get Project Structure:** Call `getProjectStructure` for `ElchananChen/Mock-Social` to identify key directories (e.g., `src`, `config`, `tests`).
2.  **Analyze Entry Points:** Look for `package.json` or main application files (e.g., `index.js`, `server.ts`) to determine the tech stack (Node.js, React, database choice, etc.).
3.  **Dive into Core Logic:** Examine files within `src/controllers`, `src/services`, or similar directories to understand the business logic and data flow.

**Conclusion:**
I am currently unable to provide the requested professional summary due to an API rate limit error encountered during the initial structure scan. Please try the request again later, or if possible, provide an API token for authenticated requests to increase the rate limit.
